# ec2inVPS

In this lav I will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple AZ's, routes and an internet gateway.

Once logged to AWS Management Console, go to VPC--> Create VPC

Whenever you create a VPC you must specify a range of IP addresses. /16 means there is support for over 65,000 IP addresses.
